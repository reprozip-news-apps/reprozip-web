Description: ReproZip
        ========
        
        `ReproZip <https://www.reprozip.org/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given command on the author's computational environment (packing step).  A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).
        
        reprounzip-docker
        -----------------
        
        This is the component responsible for the unpacking step on different environments (Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X) by using a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ container.  Please refer to `reprozip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprozip>`__, `reprounzip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprounzip>`_, and `reprounzip-vagrant <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprounzip-vagrant>`_ for other components and plugins.
